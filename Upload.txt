CMds
   -mkdir uploads
   -chmod 755 uploads
   -chmod 775 uploads
   -sudo chown -R www-data:www-data uploads/
   -ls -ld uploads

      (     
            <?php
            if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST" && isset($_FILES["image"])) {
                $uploadDir = "uploads/"; // Make sure this exists and is writable
                $uploadFile = $uploadDir . basename($_FILES["image"]["name"]);

                if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["image"]["tmp_name"], $uploadFile)) {
